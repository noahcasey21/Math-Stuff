## My math folder

This repository will hold some of my notes, papers, and problems done in mathematics. I have some of my latex files included for those interested. 

My current interests are in abstract algebra, but I have done some theoretical work in PDEs that I plan on expanding upon and loading up onto this repo upon completion.
