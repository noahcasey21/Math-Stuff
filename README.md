## My math folder

  This repository will hold some of my notes, papers, and problems done in mathematics. I have some of my LaTeX files included for those interested. 
  My current interests are in abstract algebra. 

# Quiver Representations
  These notes are over an extracurricular presentation I did with the University of Missouri Math department's directed reading program
  
# Abstract Algebra
  These are a few of my assignments that I did via LaTeX. Not all of my solutions were correct, and I did not do all of my assignments through LaTeX.
